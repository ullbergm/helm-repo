    description: Sonarr (formerly NZBdrone) is a PVR for usenet and bittorrent users.
      It can monitor multiple RSS feeds for new episodes of your favorite shows and
      will grab, sort and rename them. It can also be configured to automatically
      upgrade the quality of files already downloaded when a better quality format
      becomes available.
